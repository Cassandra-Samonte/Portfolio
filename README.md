# MVP Goals 
A welcoming landing page created using HTML, CSS, and small JavaScript animation. I want a full page design that includes interactive animation with certain sections of the page.

A dedicated section showcasing the most interesting projects. This section will be enhanced as I create more projects during the course.

Contact page to include links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and other platforms, possibly through interactive icons and a pop-out contact form.

# Stretch Goals 
Aesthetic Enhancements: Implement advanced CSS techniques for better visuals, such as transitions, shadows, and custom fonts.

User-Friendly JavaScript: Add more advanced interactive features like a sticky nav bar, tooltips, or even a small browser game to engage visitors.

API Integration: Use AJAX to pull in data from external sources, like a GitHub API to automatically update the Projects section with the latest repositories.

# Unsolved problems
Navbar buttons only work on welcome page. I was unable to troubleshoot through this and make the buttons work on the other pages of the website. 

I was also unable to properly target the logos in the footer page to change the dimensions and change the sizes of the buttons in the nav bar for different screen sizes.

The fullPage scroll feature also gets stuck and forces you to have to refresh the page.
